        <h1 class="head">Bar Louie Unveils Brand’s First-Ever Redesign in Denver</h1>
<div class="newspaper1">
    <p class="para1">Denver, CO (RestaurantNews.com) The Mile High City just got even cooler. In addition to the drop in
        temperature, Denver is now home to Bar Louie’s first-ever new prototype.
        Located in The Shops at Northfield, Bar Louie closed for several weeks during renovations and has officially
        reopened. Loyal fans will immediately notice the difference because everything – from the menu and flatware to the
        interior and exterior design – is new. The enhanced gastrobar design features new colors, lighting, booths, tables,
        chairs and barstools. There’s also renovated bathrooms, a takeout and delivery station and upgraded high-efficiency
        kitchen equipment. In addition, Bar Louie is embracing the Mile High City scene by bringing in famous Denver
        muralist, Randy Segura, to paint a one-of-a-kind floor-to-ceiling piece that will anchor the new gastrobar.<br>To
        celebrate its grand reopening, Bar Louie is decking the halls for a holiday soiree that will be so fun, even the
        Grinch is attending. On Friday, Dec. 10 from 5-10 p.m., Denverites are invited to don their tackiest sweater and
        dash over to The Original Gastrobar for an elfin’ good time. A local DJ will be playing holiday classics and Bar
        Louie has convinced the Grinch to take pictures with partygoers. To add to the excitement, there will be an ugly
        sweater contest with gift cards up for grabs – the perfect stocking stuffers – and the ultimate grand prize winner
        will get to take home a resort ski pass of their choosing for up to a $750 value! For more information, visit the
        Facebook event page.
    
        “Like most restaurants, Bar Louie has focused on surviving the pandemic while building for the future,” said Bar
        Louie CEO Tom Fricke. “We quickly initiated takeout and delivery, launched two new virtual brands, and we were able
        to resume our plans for ‘Bar Louie 4.0.’ Now, we have a strong foundation in place and we’re ready to grow. We’re
        excited to debut our new concept direction in Denver and look forward to celebrating our reopening on Friday.”
